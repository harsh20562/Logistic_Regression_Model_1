# Logistic_Regression_Model_1
My first logistic regression model

To run my program,
  1. You need to have Jupyter Notebook/Google Colab/Kaggle account to run my logistic_regression.ipynb file.
  2. I have used sk-learn , matplotlib, pandas, numpy, seaborn etc libraries of python.
  3. I have only applied LogisticRegression() model to the data.
  4. I will soon be updating the logistic_regression.ipynb file with increased accuracy by improving my model.

About the dataset:
  1. The dataset contains 34 columns and 3999 rows.
  2. For the given dataset, we are given some details about the student like gender, ID , DOB, collegeTier, collegeGPA, 10percentage, High-Salary etc. We are also given whether the student was given high salary or not. By training our model by the given data, we have to predict whether a student will get a high salary or not.
